# Embedded Systems with ARM Cortex

This repository contains a collection of lab projects completed as part of my studies in embedded systems with a focus on ARM Cortex. 

Each lab is contained within its own directory and includes the source code, documentation, and instructions for replication.

## Labs

1. [Lab 4: UART Communication and LED Timing](Lab%204/README.md)
   - Receives commands through UART to control LEDs with specific timings.
2. [Lab 5: LED Blinking with SysTick Timer](Lab%205/README.md)
   - Blinks LEDs after a delay using the SysTick timer.
3. [Lab 6: SysTick Timer and GPIO Interrupts](Lab%206/README.md)
   - Uses SysTick timer and GPIO interrupts to control LED behavior based on button presses.

## Requirements

- ARM Cortex Development Board
- UART Communication Interface
- LEDs (Red, Blue, Green)
- Switches (for some labs)
- SysTick timer
- [List any other tools or dependencies]

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohamedHussein27/Embedded-Systems-with-ARM-Cortex.git
   cd Embedded-Systems-with-ARM-Cortex
